## 2. Release notes (1.0.0)

This is the first edition of this guide. You may notice that certain topics may need further development, particularly the topic of polymorphism, and you may also observe some overlap among the principles of object-oriented programming. Nevertheless, I wanted to release an initial version quickly and be able to proceed with other projects and obligations that I have pending.

### Topics to be included in the next release:

- Relationships between classes (association, aggregation, composition, dependency)
- Testing and debugging of object-oriented code
- Object-oriented design patterns

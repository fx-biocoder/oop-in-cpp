2. [Encapsulation](./02_encapsulation/README.md)
3. [Inheritance](./03_inheritance/README.md)

## 1.1 Scope

This guide provides a comprehensive explanation of Object-Oriented programming in **modern C++ (C++17/20)**. The content has been completely updated to reflect contemporary best practices including:

- Smart pointers and modern memory management
- Move semantics and rvalue references
- Const-correctness and RAII principles
- Modern constructor patterns and initializer lists
- Standard Library containers and algorithms
- Type safety and compiler-assisted correctness

The guide emphasizes pedagogical clarity over so-called "real world examples". Still, it shows current best practices and code patterns.

## 2. Release notes (2.0.0)

**Major Update:** Complete modernization to C++17/20 standards with comprehensive improvements.

### What's New in This Version:

- ✅ All code examples updated to modern C++ (C++17/20)
- ✅ Smart pointers throughout (no more raw `new`/`delete`)
- ✅ Move semantics and rvalue references explained
- ✅ Const-correctness and RAII principles emphasized
- ✅ Fully compilable example code in `examples/` directory
- ✅ CMakeLists.txt for easy building
- ✅ Modern C++ Overview guide for quick reference
- ✅ Best Practices document with industry patterns
- ✅ Compilation scripts for all examples

### Previous Release (1.0.0):

This was the first edition of this guide. It used outdated C++ patterns that no longer reflect modern best practices.

### Topics Covered:

- ✅ Object-Oriented fundamentals (classes, objects, abstraction)
- ✅ Encapsulation and access control
- ✅ Inheritance and class hierarchies
- ✅ Polymorphism and virtual functions
- ✅ Move semantics and modern memory management
